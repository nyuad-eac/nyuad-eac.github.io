##### Maya Fayed

<img style="padding-right: 10px;" align="right" src="../assets/Maya.PNG" alt="na" width="310"/>

Hey there! I’m Maya and I’m a senior majoring in computer engineering. Home for me is Alexandria, Egypt and I’ve lived there all my life before coming to NYUAD. In terms of academic interests, I’m passionate about responsible tech as well as pursuing interdisciplinary work that leverages machine learning and data-driven engineering techniques for health and social impact applications. 
When I’m not coding, you can find me playing frisbee or struggling on the rock climbing wall;) Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or just to chat about any of these topics!

#### meet your **bioengineering** rep :syringe:
##### Abhay Menon

<img style="padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px;" align="right" src="../assets/Abhay.jpeg" alt="azl" width="300"/>

Hey! I am Abhay Menon, a rising junior majoring in BioEngineering. I am from Chennai, India and have lived there all my life before coming to NYUAD. I decided to major in BioEngineering because it applies engineering tools and approaches to find unique solutions to problems in biology and medicine. The field of bioengineering is very broad but my research interests lie primarily in visual prosthesis, bionic implants and creating more effective point of care diagnostic tools. 

I am a huge sports fan and spend most of my spare time playing basketball. With BioEngineering being a new major, if you have any questions regarding courses, professors or anything at all feel free to hit me up!
