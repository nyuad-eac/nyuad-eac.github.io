        <p>Hi everyone! I am delighted to be serving this year as the chair of the engineering student committee. I am particularly interested in developing non-invasive diagnostic tools using nano particles -which I also use in developing drug delivery platforms! Happy to always chat about anything related to bioengineering</p>

        <p>Hi! I am Rashik. I'm a senior majoring in bioengineering and am excited to be serving as the BioEng representative. I am involved with the Bioengineering Society SIG and Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES). I have been a part of the NYUAD iGEM team for almost three semesters, first as head of labs and now as team leader. I am passionate about tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and am researching on bioprinting at the Vijay Lab. Feel free to reach out to me regarding anything from the bioengineering major. I will try my best to ensure you have an amazing experience as a bioengineer at NYUAD!</p>

        <p> Hi! I'm Valentina, a senior in Mechanical Engineering, and I'mexcited to be taking on the role of MechEng representative. My passion lies in the world of composite materials and structural mechanics, and I'm particularly fascinated by their applications in aeronautical and astronautical systems. This semester, I'm actively involved in several engineering-related Special Interest Groups (SIGs), including ASME, weSTEM, and the Aerospace SIG. I'm looking forwards to connect with other engineers, so please feel free to reach out â€“ I'm always up for a good chat!</p>

        <a href="mailto:[mkm9848@nyu.edu]">[<mkm9848@nyu.edu>]</a>
        <p>Hello, I'm Mayher! I'm a CivE senior with a minor in art. I'm interested in labour ethics, construction/project management, and structural design. My interests outside of class include Sustained Dialogue, cooking/baking, reading comics, and tea (fun fact: I have about 50 kinds of tea right now). I've been part of WeSTEM/WiSTEM clubs since high school, including as a mentor at NYUAD. You can reach out to me at mkm9848@nyu.edu if you have any questions about the civil engineering major/classes/capstone (spoilers: I was very indecisive about the major but really love it, and CivE capstone is looking good so far). I'm also happy to discuss my experiences a woman in STEM, my time in New York, or the stress of being an engineer at NYUAD. Of course, I'm always here to help with any CivE course/professor issues like unreasonable workload or wanting a new elective offered.</p>

        <a href="mailto:[ae2195@nyu.edu]">[<ae2195@nyu.edu>]</a>
        <p>Hello, I am Aya, a senior majoring in computer engineering. My passion lies within the intersection of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and healthcare. I am fascinated by all applications of ML (Machine Learning) in healthcare; indeed, the one that excites me the most is neuroscience and AI, improving our understanding of the mind through ML. My research endeavors extend out to different countries across the world: the UAE, Germany, and the US (side note: please reach out if you have any questions about navigating research opportunities on campus and outside). My most recent research was on understanding bias in the decision-making of ML models in the healthcare field, more specifically, how the models we are building for the healthcare field are becoming more and more biased toward a certain privileged subset of our societies... (if that sounds like something you would want to learn more about, feel free to reach out). I also serve as part of the E-Board for the weSTEM Student Interest Group on campus (for supporting women, non-binary people, and male-identifying allies interested in science, technology, and engineering), and it has been an amazing experience to connect STEM enthusiasts through various programs such as the mentorship program (which - fun fact - I participated in my sophomore year and I am still in contact with my mentor). Lastly, I believe computer engineering is a rich major that allows you to navigate the hardware and the software sides of engineering, thus, I would be more than happy to discuss its career opportunities and the differences with computer science... and answer any questions you might have :) </p>

        <p>Hey everyone! I'm Niraj, a senior in Electrical Engineering. I've got an interest in exploring the crossroads of Robotics and Machine Learning - think of it as teaching robots to think a bit, without letting them take over the world! As an EE rep, my goal is to gather students' feedback and work to improve your experience as electrical engineering students. Feel free to reach out ;) </p>
