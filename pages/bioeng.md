**What are the Bioengineering Core Courses offered in 2021 Spring and 2021 Fall?**

2021 Spring
- Bioengineering Principles, (previously fundamentals of bioengineering)
- Biotransport
- Physical Chemistry (newly offered)

2021 Fall
- Biomechanics
- Biomaterials
- Bioimaging

**Other Information**

Since the establishment of this major, a new Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) has also started on campus. Led by Professor Rafael Song, the BMES hosts talks with guest speakers, panels with students, and also educational lectures that aim to expose students to this field beyond within academics.
