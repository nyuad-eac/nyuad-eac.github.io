<div class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-question">For the Spring semester, is it recommended I take two cores and one colloquium?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        The order you complete cores and colloquiums throughout your degree at NYUAD does not matter. It's recommended to spread them out, but it's not required. You can also take a general elective in place of a core/colloquium. Freshman year is a great time to explore other subjects or skills.

<div class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-question">As an incoming freshman trying to major in Engineering, what courses should I be taking?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        It is highly recommended that you are enrolled in three courses for the fall semester, including Computer Programming for Engineers, a Math Course, and FYWS or Core Colloquium. This will prevent you from falling behind. Students currently enrolled in only two courses (underloading), or are not enrolled in the suggested courses, should revise their schedules.

<div class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-question">What is MATH-UH 1000 A&B? Is it one semester or two semesters? How does it work?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        The MATH-UH 1000 A&B is a new course set up by the Math department. It replaces the previously available set of pre-calculus courses (Vectors, Functions, Trigonometry). Each “section” (A&B) are 2-credits and are meant to be completed in the same semester. The course is also meant to be completed prior to enrolling in Calculus.
    </div>

<div class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-question">I placed into MATH-UH 1000 A&B, but I do not feel like this placement accurately reflects my math level. What can I do about this?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        As of July 14, 2021, The Math Department have clarified that they will not entertain any appeals for the CPT results. There is nothing the Engineering Department nor the EAC can do about this. The Science Department is looking into making Calculus a co-requsite along with FOS but it is uncertain as of now.

<div class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-question">I placed into MATH-UH 1000 A&B. Will this affect my study-aways or J-terms?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        You will still be able to study away for a semester. Once the bulletin is released we will be able to show when this study-away would take place. You should still have the same number of J-term courses (3).

<div class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-question">I want to major in Engineering but may also switch into X. What courses should I do?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        That’s a really difficult question to answer because there it depends on how likely you are, how you feel after taking the introductory courses, and what you placed into. However, when making your decision, do keep in mind that all Natural Science and Engineering courses will require you to do FOS. Also, keep in mind that if you achieve an A- or above in Computer Programming for Engineers, this can transfer over to credits for Introduction to Computer Science. Also, keep in mind that you can complete an Engineering minor if you start FOS but switch majors later.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-question">Since FOS 3/4 are no longer required, what are the other courses that we should take in order to replace the science courses requirement?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        The extension of certain math courses (e.g. Linear Algebra, ODE, etc) covers your math/science ABET requirements. You don’t have to worry about this. For those opting out of FOS 3/4 , you must do either Quantitative Synthetic Biology or Electromagnetics (for Engineers?) course. Keep in mind that for those wishing to major in Bioengineering, FOS 1-6 will still be required.

<div class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-question">Is it possible to do a minor in Aerospace engineering?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        Incoming students should NOT plan on pursuing an aerospace minor. This is due to changing demands and course availability. Current students, if you are able to complete your requirements for the minor through the NYU New York course this fall, please take advantage of this.

<div class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-question">What are the categories we will be evaluated on in order to have 2 study away semesters?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        Typically, study away for engineers takes place junior spring in New York. As of now, engineering students who have a GPA of 3.9 and above at the end of their Sophomore year may also qualify for a second study-away semester in NY in the fall of their junior year. Those students must have completed Foundations of Science 1 & 2, Computer Programming for Engineers, Design and Innovation, and all the required math courses. More information can be found [here](https://students.nyuad.nyu.edu/academics/global-education/study-away/study-abroad-paths/).

<div class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-question">In the sample schedule for computer engineering, there is a course named Computer Systems Programming. What is this, I can’t find it anywhere else?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        This refers to Object-Oriented Programming. The course was renamed but you may find older sources that still carry this previous name.
