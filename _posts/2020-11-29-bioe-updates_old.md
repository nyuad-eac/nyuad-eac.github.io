**Who is allowed to major in Bioengineering?**

Any student currently enrolled in NYU Abu Dhabi, and will complete Bioengineering Requirements before graduation, is eligible to graduate with a Bioengineering Degree under Bachelors of Science. Students wishing to double major in Bioengineering and another major should check double-counting rules for courses. In addition, the structure is designed to allow students to complete medical or health school application requirements prior to graduation.

**What are the Bioengineering Requirements?**

Students are required to complete:
- Foundations of Science 1-6
- 16 credits of Math (check the Engineering Math Course Requirements)
- Computer Programming for Engineers
- Design and Innovation
- 20 credits of Bioengineering Electives (3 of which from Engineering, 2 of which from Sciences such as Biology, Physics, Chemistry)
- Engineering Core Courses: Circuits, Statics, Conservation laws
- Bioengineering Core Courses: Bioengineering Principles, Biomechanics, Biotransport, Biomimaging, Biomaterials, Physical Chemistry

**What are the Bioengineering Core Courses offered in 2021 Spring and 2021 Fall?**

2021 Spring
- Bioengineering Principles, (previously fundamentals of bioengineering)
- Biotransport
- Physical Chemistry (newly offered)

2021 Fall
- Biomechanics
- Biomaterials
- Bioimaging

**Other Information**

Since the establishment of this major, a new Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) has also started on campus. Led by Professor Rafael Song, the BMES hosts talks with guest speakers, panels with students, and also educational lectures that aim to expose students to this field beyond within academics. Feel free to email zhl232@nyu.edu if you are interested in joining and receiving emails and updates regarding the events.
