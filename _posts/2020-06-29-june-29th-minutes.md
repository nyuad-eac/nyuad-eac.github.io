**Will there be engineering classes that are normally offered in Spring be offered in the Fall Semester?**

This next academic year (fall 2020) will largely have the same courses as the previous years. The changes accompanying the new FOS requirement, will only take place in the following academic year (fall 2021).

**Will the Dynamics course be offered next fall semester?**

No

**With the Remote Plus, some students will be allowed to come back to campus. Will the lab sessions be held in person as well as online or will they be entirely online?**

All lab sessions will be held online, with an exception for capstone students

**What are my options if I decide to take a leave of absence and my teammates don't? Can I work on capstone with them remotely while on leave?**

Leaves of absences are strongly discouraged for senior students as they must be enrolled in Capstone seminars. If you take a leave you would have to find new teammates and a new topic. Serious health concerns will be accommodate for but overall, don’t plan for a LOA

**How remote will the important/non-elective engineering classes be? What to do if I cannot study home and need to come to campus to perform to the best of my abilities? When will we find out if we are returning on campus?**

The only students who will be allowed on campus at this point, by policy, are the seniors. Freshmen will be entirely online.

**What is the possibility of opening new sections for waitlisted courses for those who require it? (for instance, linear algebra and ordinary differential equations, structural component analysis)**

Ozgur:

Linear Algebra and ODE the math division offers these programs. We are in continuous conversation with them. They are going to open a new section. If there are students who are still waitlisted please let me know. Latest that I knew is that things were opening a new section, if not please reach out to me.

If there is an issue with an engineering division course, structural component analysis for example, let me know. We’ll do everything we can to resolve this. &lt;os22@nyu.edu>

New sections of ODE and Linear Algebra should show on albert soon according to Samer.

**Why does the Go Local sample courses show no option for Engineering classes?**

Go local was really meant for cities where we have a campus or close to a city where we have a campus.

**In case Go Local is an available choice for NYUAD students, which sites do we expect to offer engineering courses, if any?**

New York in general. Shanghai for rising sophomores. Distinction between remote instruction and go local. Remote learning is not a study away. Go local is only study away if you need NYU funding. If you have already done 2 study aways, and you need funding you cannot do go funding again.

**Course equivalencies**

Check the course equivalencies on the student portal. It is always an option to look at remote instruction tandon courses. For seniors this will be looking at elective courses. For juniors, it’ll be a little tricky, because the junior fall courses are Abu Dhabi specific. The courses you need that you need to take in junior fall need to follow a specific credit format. If for some reason you want to take the New York variant of a class, check in with the engineering admin first. It is highly recommended to take those courses in Abu Dhabi.

**Can we lift or amend the study away restrictions (i.e. limiting study away for engineers to the one NY study away) so that engineers can take advantage of Go Local and have it count as a second study away?**

For Go Local in New York, you can all your courses online, you no longer need to do one in person class. If you have not done Shanghai, and you do go local in NY, you can still study away in spring. If you need housing it will count as a study away, but it will not prevent you from studying away in spring**(?)**

**How does the engineering department plan to handle course labs and capstone lab work if we can not access campus labs? While simulation tools exist, they are not always a good substitution.**

If seniors need a lab for capstone, the plan is that these will be accessible. Course instruction is going to be entirely only labs and lectures due to government regulations.

**Does the engineering department have an opinion on students taking a leave of absence and doing other things to avoid missing out on in-person lab work?**

If you can afford to not take a LoA, then you shouldn’t. For those who have to, it is what it is. For seniors we have a stronger opinion against it.

**How will labs be held for courses like Circuit Fundamentals and Engineering materials?**

It depends. Not all labs are the same: some require laptops while others require physical lab work. This could be in the form of pre-recorded experiments and data analysis and reports on the student’s end, for example.

**If we decide to do Go Local, would we still have our NY study away in spring?**

For Go Local in New York, you can do all your courses online, you no longer need to do one in person class. If you have not done Shanghai, and you do go local in NY, you can still study away in spring.

### Incoming Freshmen

**Is it confirmed that incoming freshmen will no longer have to take FOS3/4? If so, does this bring any changes to scheduling for freshmen engineers?**

Confirmed for incoming freshmen, but also an option for the rising sophomores. Bioengineering still needs fos 3/4. In their sophomore fall, the incoming freshmen will take Engineering common courses (ECCs) so that they can choose the discipline sooner.If an incoming freshmen wants to FOS 3/4  they are permitted to take it. They will not need to do the additional science class in that case, but still need to do the 4 credit versions of the math classes.

Incoming engineering students will take a math course. Calc, precalc, mvc, etc. and computer programming for engineers + a FYWS or a colloquium.

No jterm. 2 summer sessions. D&I will be in the first 3 week session (in person).

**Since 2021 J-term is no longer happening, will there still be a trigonometry to calculus path that was introduced for the class of 2021?**

No. Math department replaced everything prior to calculus, with a single class. If incoming freshmen place into this class, they will have to wait to do calc in spring. Science division is in the process of completely revising their FOS classes. Calc prerequisite may be dropped for FOS 1/2 , though not necessarily. _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">IMPORTANT NOTE: </span>_Better to revise for the math placement exam so that you do not fall behind.

If you want a pleasant experience, place into calculus or into mvc. If you do not place in calc or mvc, it’ll push things later and mess up study plans. This summer is the incoming freshmens opportunity to study for the math discipline. Hopefully the science division makes FOS changes, but don’t count on it. Math placement is earlier this year.

**Are there any updates to study away eligibility for engineers? How is the Shanghai study away decided?**

This coming fall is the last shanghai study away for students who passed fos 34. After this with the new curriculum, there is no more Shanghai study away. 4 Engineering common courses will be offered in sophomore fall, + quantitative synthetic biology or physics class for engineers.

New York maybe an option for study away in fall of junior year for a small number of highly performing students.

Although **not confirmed**, if a rising sophomore wishes to have two new york study aways, they should probably not study away in Shanghai. You will not be given 3 study aways.

**On behalf of the rising Juniors**. **Can we move our study away to our senior fall?**

NY is recovering faster. Hybrid model, rotation policy. One third of the students will be on campus one day of the week. Group 1, go to classes on monday and thursday, etc.. By the spring semester things should be normal. Nobody can predict what will happen, but currently at this point in time we expect that study away in spring will commence.

**Clarification about go local and study away:**

If you are a student who has not done any study away, but you want to go local in new york with university paying for you, your second spring study away semester will **not be** in jeopardy.

**Transcript policy next semester?**

No answer yet. An answer will surface and be communicated soon.

**Will labs be accessible to UAE residents who wish to commute to campus instead of living in the dorms? Or is the expectation to live on campus entirely if we wish to have to gain the limited access to labs for capstone for example?**

Does not have the answer yet. If you live in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, I do not think it matters if you live on campus or not. Seniors should have a very high priority for labs. If it was up to Samer this is his opinion.

**What is the course scheduling like for those who want to take a NY minor? (e.g.: Minor in Aerospace Engineering)**

Will discontinue offering the compressible flow course due to lack of expertise of the faculty, which prevents accessibility of the aerospace engineering minor to NYUAD students. The only exception will be if you are able to take two study away semesters.

**Will engineering common courses (ECCs) be offered in the summer?**

Other than Design and Innovation, no. This academic year will have the same scheduling as prior years generally. The academic year after this one will have ECC courses will have each ECC offered in fall 1 and fall 2

**Follow up on J-terms, are all freshmen expected to take the D&I during the "June-term"? Is it going to be remote?**

It will not be remote.

**Would the second study away apply to incoming freshmen only or rising sophomores as well?**

Still in discussion state, so nothing is confirmed yet. The implementation cannot be in this upcoming academic year. Though if your GPA is high it is likely that this will be the case. BUT you cannot have gone to Shanghai.
